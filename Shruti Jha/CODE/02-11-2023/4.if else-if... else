#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int num;
    cout<<"Enter a number: ";
    cin>>num;
    if(num%2==0)
    cout<<num<<" is divisible by 2"<<endl;
    // 6 is divisible by both 2 and 3 but output will be "6 is divisible by 2" only as "else-if" statement will only be executed if "if" statement is false.So to solve this problem  we can use multiple if statement
    else if(num%3==0)
    cout<<num<<" is divisible by 3"<<endl;
    else
    cout<<num<<" is divisible by numbers other than 2 and 3"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
